Disclaimer: This code was created as an exercise to test my practical skills and not just rely on theory. If I were to create the complete tax code, I would need to add an API connected to the list of municipalities throughout Italy, which is approximately 13,000, and another API connected to the list of provinces. I manually wrote some provinces and municipalities just to test the code. Perhaps in the future, I will connect these APIs to improve the functionality of the tax code :).
